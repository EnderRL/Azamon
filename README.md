# Azamon

Azamon a is a fictional company that organize the package delivery of a certain city. It has some organization issues, so we resolved that using classic Aritifical Intellinge algorithms. This project was made during the subject Artificial Intelligence in the Bachelor's Degree in Computer's Engineering of the Computer School of Barcelona of the Politechnical University of Catalonia.

# Algorithms

To solve the organization issues we used the **Simulated Annealing** and the **Hill Climbing** algorithm. In order to run both algorithms we implemented problem generators and heuristics. 

# Structure

- In the folder `src\IA\Gneradores` you can find the problem generators.
- In the folder `src\IA\Heuristicos` you can find the algorithm heuristics.
- In the folder `src\IA\Experimentos` you can find different scenarios in which we ran our algorithms, modifying the different parameters, problems and heuristics. The results of these experiments are located in the `results` folder.

# Documentation
Documentation of the language is located in `Documentaci√≥n Azamon.pdf`.
